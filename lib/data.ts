    excerpt:
      "In the current digital landscape, privacy is no longer a luxury — it's an expectation. As more systems move on-chain, the transparency that blockchain offers begins to clash with users' desire for discretion. At Zicket, we've made it our mission to challenge this tension, especially within the event space. Ticketing, at its core, is about access — to spaces, ideas, people, and moments. Yet the way most platforms manage access today is both invasive and outdated. This is why we've been building on Aztec's privacy-first infrastructure, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to reshape the foundation of event verification. What follows is a detailed account of what we've learned so far and how ZK is changing the way we think about event participation, access rights, and anonymity.",

        heading: "Why Privacy Needs to Be Baked into Events",
        paragraphs: [
          "Traditional ticketing systems prioritize convenience over privacy. When users register for events, their personal and wallet information is often logged, indexed, and made publicly accessible. While this might seem harmless in the context of a concert or festival, it poses serious concerns for more sensitive events — like governance meetings, DAO community gatherings, private workshops, or culturally-specific spaces that thrive in intimacy. What we often forget is that access control is not just about letting the right people in; it's about keeping visibility controlled, preserving the intent behind an experience, and protecting both hosts and attendees.",
          "Zero-knowledge technology offers a unique opportunity to invert this model. Instead of revealing data to prove legitimacy, ZK allows users to prove ownership, identity, or membership without disclosing the underlying details. On Zicket, this means that someone can show they're allowed into an event without ever revealing their wallet address or token holdings. It redefines the baseline for trust — you don't need to see my credentials, only know that they're valid.",
        ],
      },
      {
        heading: "What ZK Unlocks for Access Control on Zicket",
        paragraphs: [
          "Zicket is designed from the ground up to be privacy-native. Thanks to Aztec's encrypted smart contracts, we've developed a system where tickets function as private credentials — invisible to third parties, verifiable to hosts. The core capability here is selective disclosure. For example, a user attending a private retreat can receive a ticket that only becomes visible to the host for verification purposes. From the user's perspective, they maintain complete control over what is shared and when.",
          "Beyond tickets, ZK enables role-based access without identity leakage. A DAO can host an event and allow only voting members in, with Zicket verifying the necessary token ownership privately. Community leaders can create invite-only events where entry is granted based on off-chain criteria encoded as private proofs of membership. These workflows would be impossible or deeply invasive without privacy technology. We've also enabled proof-of-location integrations (still in early testing) that allow event hosts to limit attendance by geography — without storing or tracking a user's physical address. These are the building blocks of private coordination at scale.",
        ],
      },
      {
        heading: "Building with Aztec: Challenges and Lessons",
        paragraphs: [
          "Implementing privacy at the protocol level isn't without challenges. ZK circuits are computationally heavy and require thoughtful UX design to avoid alienating non-technical users. From the start, we prioritized a hybrid experience — defaulting to ZK-native verification for users with compatible wallets, while providing fallback paths for others using traditional sign-ins and attestations. This way, everyone can participate, but privacy-enhancing options are always available.",
          "On the dev side, one of the biggest hurdles was balancing performance with encryption. Aztec's zkRollup system allows for private smart contracts, but that also means rethinking how we store ticket metadata, how long proofs are valid, and how event hosts retrieve verification signals. We had to build new UX patterns — such as encrypted RSVP links and time-limited ticket unlocks — to handle this new paradigm. Despite the complexity, the payoff has been immense. Every time a user checks into a Zicket event without revealing who they are to anyone but the system, we see the future more clearly.",
        ],
      },
      {
        heading: "Real-World Applications and Adoption",
        paragraphs: [
          "The most compelling validation of our approach has come from our early adopters. In one instance, a developer DAO used Zicket to host a closed strategy retreat. Members received tickets through encrypted channels, and only those able to generate a proof of DAO contribution gained entry. There were no spreadsheets, no wallet screenings — just seamless, private access. Another example came from a spiritual community that wanted to protect the sacredness of their gathering. With Zicket, they created an event where only holders of a unique digital badge could view the event's full details or request entry. These use cases highlight how versatile and meaningful private access can be.",
          "We've seen interest from hackathons, think tanks, artist communities, and founders launching stealth products. What unites them is a desire for control — not just over who attends, but how the experience is framed and preserved. Zicket makes that control native and effortless.",

Our roadmap includes anonymous Q&A sessions, encrypted check-in confirmation, and a plug-and-play tool for private group chats. More ambitiously, we're working toward interoperable credentials — where your proof of attendance in one Zicket event can unlock access elsewhere, without revealing the site when you attended.",
